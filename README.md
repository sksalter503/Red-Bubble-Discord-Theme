# Red-Bubble-Discord-Theme
I customized the living hell out of the Discord Dark Matter theme, now its red and white instead of blue and blackish. It still is a little blackish though.

==REQUIREMENTS==
1. You need Discord to be installed
2. You need better discord to be installed along with the plugins and themes update if you are installing it as a theme using the first option

==INSTALLATION OPTION I==
1. Put the .css file into your C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes
2. Restart Discord
3. Go to the themes menu in your settings (if it isn't there turn off accelerated hardware, it causes problems with betterdiscord)
4. Turn on the theme
5. Profit

==INSTALLATION OPTION II==
1. Open the .css file in some sort of text editor (Adobe Edge Code works fine)
2. Copy and paste everything in that file into the custom css part of the discord settings
3. Profit
